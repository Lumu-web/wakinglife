			<h2>About WLM</h2>
			
			<p align="center">Thanks for checking us out!!! You're Awesome! Waking Life Magazine is all about bringing you the stories of young, fresh and up-and-coming youths of today. We take some focus away from the celebs & shift that focus on the ones that really matter... YOU! Focusing on positivity & truth, our stories aim to inspire those who have dreams but don't have the motivation, support or belief to pursue their dreams with everything they have. So by showing the world that there are people who are doing so, people who matter, we hope to motivate & inspire anyone else, to do the same!
			<br/><br/>
			We also cover some of the sickest parties & create memories for you to share with your mates! We bring you the best of parties/festivals such as Homecoming Picnic & H2O! Exclusive interviews from some of the celebs on show & present to you a party vibe which you'll never forget!</p>
